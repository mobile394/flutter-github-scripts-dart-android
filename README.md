This repository contains scripts written in Dart to report on various
aspects of code health within the
[Flutter](https://flutter.dev) [repository](https://github.com/flutter).

They're probably not terribly useful if you're not a Flutter
contributor, but you might find some snippets here that
show you how to access Github using either GraphQL or the
REST API.

## Setup

You must have an environment variable `GITHUB_TOKEN` set with a valid GitHub token
for any of these scripts to work.
